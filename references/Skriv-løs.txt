Should the car kill the irresponsible biker wearing shorts and a tank top or hit the biker wearing full armor? 
If nothing can be avoided should it kill the driver? 
New problem, since we in the situation would take a spontaneous decision and would not be blamed for it.
Here we have to take the decision up front. But why are we not blamed? 
Can we even justify blaming an algorithm? Should we blame the programmer? 
Maybe unsupervised machine learning would solve the blaming aspect of it, but it is an unsolved problem.
Maybe it would be better to make the car take a random choice? 
What/how do we as humans make that choice? I'd personally go for the responsible biker. Self-preservation instincts are too strong.
What about the greater good? Is killing the "driver" the right thing to do? Is it "noble"? Sacrificing yourself = good? 
Should age matter? Illness? Is determining all of these things even possible?
