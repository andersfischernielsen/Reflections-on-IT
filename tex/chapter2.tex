\chapter{General Ethics and Computer Ethics}Computer ethics, and generally ethics of technology, is evolving along with the corresponding technologies of the time. This is one of the main problems of computer ethics, and also why it is important to discuss. As Moor says:
\textquote{Computers provides us with new capabilities and these in turn give us new choices for action. [...] A central task of computer ethics is to deter- mine what we should do in such cases, i.e., to formulate policies to guide our actions.}\todo{cite.}


\section{Consequentialism}
In the study of normative ethics, consequentialism holds that the consequences of one's conduct are the basis of which to determine the rightness or wrongfulness of one's actions. That is, the means to which you achieve your goal pose no ethical relevance, rather the end result is what has ethical relevance. It is the idea that the end justifies the means. \cite{mizzoni2009ethics}

\subsection{Utilitarianism}
Utilitarianism is a form of consequentialism, founded by Jeremy Bentham, holding that the best moral action is the one that maximises \textit{utility}, that is the well being of sentient beings. The action that maximises the well being and minimises the suffering of humans is the one most ethically correct.
