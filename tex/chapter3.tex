\chapter{Ethics of Autonomous Vehicles}

According to utilitarianists, no matter the ethical issues involved in possible critical situations involving autonomous cars, having autonomous cars will always be ethically sound, since autonomous cars, even with many critical situations, will save more lives overall. Even if the act of selecting individuals to hit if it is unavoidable, the end result - drastically lowering the current amount of people killed in accidents - will maximise the well-being of humans. Therefore developing autonomous cars, as long as this saves more lives, will be a good thing.
